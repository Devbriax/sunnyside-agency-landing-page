## Overview
### The challenge
- The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
- This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. But you could also choose to do this without JS!
- You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
